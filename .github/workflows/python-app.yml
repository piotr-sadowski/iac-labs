# This workflow will install Python dependencies, run tests and lint with a single version of Python
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-python
# separate building dependencies : poetry install, project dependencies
# separate static test of code: linter, formatter, security
# separate unit tests
